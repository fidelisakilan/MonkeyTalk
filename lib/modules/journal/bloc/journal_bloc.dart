        "Woke up exhausted after another late night. I keep telling myself I'll sleep early, but it never happens. Quick breakfast‚Äîcoffee and a granola bar, my usual. While walking to class, I realized I haven't worked out all week. Kept telling myself I'd go tomorrow, but let's be real. OS lecture was overwhelming, and I barely processed half of it. My break time was supposed to be for studying, but I ended up scrolling my phone instead.\n\nLunch was chill, but my friends were talking about FIFA night. I realized I haven‚Äôt played in forever. Library session was meant to be productive, but distractions won. Group project meeting reminded me of how much work we still have left. Got another email about my missed guitar lesson‚Äîshould I just cancel at this point?\n\nEvening was another struggle. I planned to hit the gym, but I convinced myself I was too tired. Instead, I made instant noodles for dinner, tried studying, and ended up watching random YouTube videos. Finally, I caved and joined FIFA night. It was fun, but now I regret the time lost. The cycle continues."

By mid-morning, I took a break and *thought* about going to the gym. Didn‚Äôt happen. Instead, I wasted time on social media.\n\nLunch was another simple dorm meal‚Äîsandwich and chips. I had a group project check-in, and everyone is just as stressed as me, which made me feel slightly better. The rest of the afternoon was mostly filled with studying, though I wasn‚Äôt as productive as I wanted to be. My parents texted me, and I ignored it for a bit. Not intentionally, I just didn't have the energy to talk. \n\nBy the evening, I ordered food with my roommate because I was too lazy to cook. That gave me a second wind, and I finally managed to get some studying done. The guilt from wasting time earlier in the day hit hard, but at least I ended on a somewhat productive note."

The exam is getting closer, and I still don‚Äôt feel ready. \n\nTook a break around noon and *considered* a quick workout. Didn't happen. Instead, I stayed in my room, had a basic lunch, and kept working on OS problems. Group project meeting took up part of the afternoon‚Äînothing new, just more reminders of how much we still have to do. Finally replied to my parents, just a simple 'Busy with school.'\n\nEvening was more studying, but I hit a wall. Ordered food again because I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to cook. After dinner, I tried studying one last time, but my focus was completely gone. Ended up wasting time on my phone instead. I have way too much to do, and I feel like I wasted another day."

Library session was meant to be productive, but distractions won again. Group project meeting added more stress. Skipped the gym *again* because I convinced myself I was too busy. \n\nBy evening, I microwaved some mac & cheese, struggled through debugging a CS assignment, and half-heartedly tried to study. Finally called my parents after putting it off for a while‚Äîthey could hear the exhaustion in my voice. Ended the night watching a couple of episodes of a show with my roommate. Probably not the best use of time, but I needed a break."
